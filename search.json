    "text": "Analysis\nChristmas weather in Philadelphia is notoriously unpredictable. To understand how unusual this variability really is, this blog will examine daily weather records from 2005 - 2025, focusing on Christmas Day and placing it in the context of broader temperature, snowfall, and extreme weather trends.\nWe will ultimately determine if it is worth staying in Philadelphia for the holiday season.\n\nHow variable is the temperature on Christmas day in Philadelphia?\n\nchristmas_df = weather_df.query(\"day=='December 25'\").set_index('year')[['high','low']]\nchristmas_df.plot(kind = 'line', style = '-o')\nplt.title(\"Changes in Low and High Temperature for Christmas Day over Time\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Day temperatures fluctuate substantially from year to year, with no clear monotonic trend over the period.\n\nprint(f\"Hottest Christmas: {christmas_df['high'].idxmax()}, {christmas_df['high'].max()} degrees F.\")\nprint(f\"Coldest Christmas: {christmas_df['low'].idxmin()}, {christmas_df['low'].min()} degrees F.\")\nprint(f\"Greatest temperature change: {(christmas_df['high'] - christmas_df['low']).idxmax()}, with a temperature difference between high and low of {(christmas_df['high'] - christmas_df['low']).max()} degrees Farenheit.\")\n\nHottest Christmas: 2015, 68 degrees F.\nColdest Christmas: 2022, 18 degrees F.\nGreatest temperature change: 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nThe hottest Christmas in the dataset was in 2015, with a high temperature of 68 degrees Farenheit. An additional interesting fact is that 2015 was the hottest Christmas in any year from 1874 to 2025, tied only with Christmas in 1964. (According to https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe coldest Christmas in the dataset was in 2022, with a low temperature of 18 degrees Farenheit. However, this is still 17 degrees Farenheit warmer than the coldest Christmas day, which was in 1980 and 1983, which had a minimum temperature of just 1 degree Farenheit. (https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe Christmas with the greatest temperature change was in 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nChanges in Annual Snowfall\n\nannual_snow = weather_df.groupby('year')['snow'].sum()\n\nx = annual_snow.index.values\ny = annual_snow.values\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Total Snowfall, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Snowfall (inches)\")\n\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = True).head(5)\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n2010    67.3\n2014    56.9\n2009    45.6\n2005    37.0\n2011    31.6\nName: snow, dtype: float64\n\n\nBased on the above regression line on the yearly total snowfall over the past 20 years, we can see that the amount of snow recorded in Philadelphia has decreased over the years.\n2010 saw the greatest amount of snow in the data set receiving 67.3 inches, which is 11.6 inches more than 2014, the year with the second highest snowfall. An interesting fact is that during this year’s snowstorm on January 26, certain parts of Philadelphia received 9.3 inches of snow, which is already more snow than the total yearly snowfall observed in 2023, 2012, 2008 and 2020.\n\n\nLong Term Temperature Trends\n\nweather_df['avg'] = (weather_df['high'] + weather_df['low']) / 2\n\nyearly_avg = weather_df.groupby('year')['avg'].mean()\n\n# Obtaining the index and values for the plot.\nx = yearly_avg.index.values\ny = yearly_avg.values\n\n# Creating a regression line.\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\n# Increasing size of plot.\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\n# Plotting observed data and the regression line on the same plot.\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Average Temperature, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\n\n# Adjusting the indexing so only every two years labelled.\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation: y = 0.0907 * x + -125.2568\n\n\nWe can see that there were many fluctuations in the yearly average temperature, with peaks in 2006, 2012, 2016, 2021, 2024.\nThe plotted regression line on the graph shows that the yearly average temperature increases as the years went by. More specifically, every year, the yearly average temperature goes up by 0.0907 degrees Farenheit on average. The fitted trend suggests an increase in average temperature over this period, though year-to-year variability is still large.\n\n\nChanges in Average Temperature in December over the Years\n\ndecember_df = weather_df[weather_df['date'].dt.month == 12]\n\ndec_avg_by_year = december_df.groupby(december_df['date'].dt.year)['avg'].mean()\n\n# Regression line\nx = dec_avg_by_year.index.values.astype(float)\ny = dec_avg_by_year.values.astype(float)\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed (Dec average)')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Linear trend')\n\nplt.title(\"Average Temperature in December by Year\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Temperature (°F)\")\nplt.xticks(x[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nEquation: y = 0.0760 * x + -113.4909\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression line suggests that the average December temperature has been rising slowly throughout time, increasing an average of 0.076 degrees Farenheit every year. We can also see that there was an unusually warm December in 2015, with an average temperature above 50 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nTemperature Extremes over Time\n\nhighest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['high'].max()\nlowest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['low'].min()\n\nx = highest_temps.index.values\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\nplt.plot(x, highest_temps, label='Annual max temp')\nplt.plot(x, lowest_temps, label='Annual min temp')\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\nplt.title(\"Annual Highest and Lowest Temperatures\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nmean_max_temp = highest_temps.mean()\nmean_min_temp = lowest_temps.mean()\n\nprint(f\"Mean annual max temp: {mean_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Mean annual min temp: {mean_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nstd_max_temp = highest_temps.std()\nstd_min_temp = lowest_temps.std()\n\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual max temp: {std_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual min temp: {std_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nyear_highest_max = highest_temps.idxmax()\nyear_lowest_min = lowest_temps.idxmin()\n\nprint(f\"Year with highest annual max temp: {year_highest_max}, temp: {highest_temps.max()}\")\nprint(f\"Year with lowest annual min temp: {year_lowest_min}, temp: {lowest_temps.min()}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean annual max temp: 98.19\nMean annual min temp: 9.52\nStd dev of annual max temp: 2.16\nStd dev of annual min temp: 4.57\nYear with highest annual max temp: 2010, temp: 103\nYear with lowest annual min temp: 2015, temp: 2\n\n\nThe annual maximum temperatures were fairly consistent throughout the 20 years, with a standard deviation of 2.16 degrees and an average maximum temperature of 98.19 degrees. The year with the hottest day was in 2010, with a temperature of 103 degrees, which interestingly enough was the year with the highest recorded annual snowfall in the dataset.\nAnnual minimum temperatures have greater temperature fluctuation, with standard deviation of 4.57 degrees. The average annual minimum temperatures was 9.52 degrees. The year with the coldest day was in 2015 at 2 degrees, but this is interesting as it had an unusually warm December as outlined previously."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWeather patterns in Philadelphia over the past two decades point to a combination of gradual warming, declining snowfall, and substantial variability in winter conditions. Christmas Day, in particular, shows no consistent pattern, however, analysis of the weather more broadly in the past 20 years indicates a gradual increase in average temperatures alongside fewer sustained periods of heavy snowfall.\nFrom the decreases in snowfall and increases in average temperature, we would recommend that if you want snow-filled winter, it may be preferable to spend the holiday season elsewhere. However, if you are staying in Philadelphia, one can enjoy warmer average temperatures through the holiday season compared to 20 years ago."
