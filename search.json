I am here for one semester and I am excited to see what UPenn has to offer!\nAn interesting fact about me would be that I was actually born in Los Angeles, but moved to South Korea for a couple of years, before moving again to Australia where I study now. As a result, I have both an American and Australian passport.\nThis blog will outline my exploration of data and the analyses / conclusions which are derived from it."

An additional interesting fact is that 2015 was the hottest Christmas in any year from 1874 to 2025, tied only with Christmas in 1964. (According to https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe coldest Christmas in the dataset was in 2022, with a low temperature of 18 degrees Farenheit. However, this is still 17 degrees Farenheit warmer than the coldest Christmas day, which was in 1980 and 1983, which had a minimum temperature of just 1 degree Farenheit. (https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe Christmas with the greatest temperature change was in 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nQuestion 2: How did the yearly average temperature change from 2005-2025?\n\nweather_df['avg'] = (weather_df['high'] + weather_df['low']) / 2\n\nyearly_avg = weather_df.groupby('year')['avg'].mean()\n\n# Obtaining the index and values for the plot.\nx = yearly_avg.index.values\ny = yearly_avg.values\n\n# Creating a regression line.\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\n# Increasing size of plot.\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\n# Plotting observed data and the regression line on the same plot.\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Average Temperature, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\n\n# Adjusting the indexing so only every two years labelled.\nplt.xticks(yearly_avg.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation: y = 0.0907 * x + -125.2568\n\n\nFrom the plot above, we can see that there were many fluctuations in the yearly average temperature, with peaks in 2006, 2012, 2016, 2021, 2024.\nThe plotted regression line on the graph shows that the yearly average temperature increases as the years went by. More specifically, every year, the yearly average temperature goes up by 0.0907 degrees Farenheit on average. This clearly demonstrates the effects on global warming over the past 20 years.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Which days of the week experienced the most rain?\n\ndaily_rain = weather_df.groupby('dow_name')['rain'].sum().reindex(['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday']) # reindexing so that days start on Monday.\n\ndaily_rain.plot(kind = 'bar')\ndaily_rain.sort_values()\n\ndow_name\nMonday       120.22\nThursday     129.81\nTuesday      133.53\nSunday       137.94\nWednesday    139.84\nSaturday     148.48\nFriday       149.46\nName: rain, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above bar plot, it is evident that Friday was the day of the week which had the highest amount of total accumulated rain, with a total of 149.46 inches of rain over the past 20 years. It is followed closely by Saturday at 148.48 inches, before dropping by a considerable margin to 139.84 inches.\nThis suggests that weekends over the past two decades experienced relatively higher rainfall accumulation. However, this relationship is purely observational and should not be interpreted as a systematic weekday effect.\n\n\n4. How did annual total snowfall change over time?\n\nannual_snow = weather_df.groupby('year')['snow'].sum()\n\nx = annual_snow.index.values\ny = annual_snow.values\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Total Snowfall, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Snowfall (inches)\")\n\nplt.xticks(yearly_avg.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = True).head(5)\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n2010    67.3\n2014    56.9\n2009    45.6\n2005    37.0\n2011    31.6\nName: snow, dtype: float64\n\n\nBased on the above regression line on the yearly total snowfall over the past 20 years, we can see that the amount of snow recorded in Philadelphia has decreased over the years.\n2010 saw the greatest amount of snow in the data set receiving 67.3 inches, which is 11.6 inches more than 2014, the year with the second highest snowfall. An interesting fact is that during this year’s snowstorm on January 26, certain parts of Philadelphia received 9.3 inches of snow, which is already more snow than the total yearly snowfall observed in 2023, 2012, 2008 and 2020.\n\n\nQuestion 5: How did the highest and lowest recorded temperatures for each year change over time?\n\nhighest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['high'].max()\nlowest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['low'].min()\n\nx = highest_temps.index.values\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\nplt.plot(x, highest_temps, label='Annual max temp')\nplt.plot(x, lowest_temps, label='Annual min temp')\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\nplt.title(\"Annual Highest and Lowest Temperatures\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nmean_max_temp = highest_temps.mean()\nmean_min_temp = lowest_temps.mean()\n\nprint(f\"Mean annual max temp: {mean_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Mean annual min temp: {mean_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nstd_max_temp = highest_temps.std()\nstd_min_temp = lowest_temps.std()\n\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual max temp: {std_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual min temp: {std_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nyear_highest_max = highest_temps.idxmax()\nyear_lowest_min = lowest_temps.idxmin()\n\nprint(f\"Year with highest annual max temp: {year_highest_max}, temp: {highest_temps.max()}\")\nprint(f\"Year with lowest annual min temp: {year_lowest_min}, temp: {lowest_temps.min()}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean annual max temp: 98.19\nMean annual min temp: 9.52\nStd dev of annual max temp: 2.16\nStd dev of annual min temp: 4.57\nYear with highest annual max temp: 2010, temp: 103\nYear with lowest annual min temp: 2015, temp: 2\n\n\nThe annual maximum temperatures were fairly consistent throughout the 20 years, with a standard deviation of 2.16 degrees and an average maximum temperature of 98.19 degrees. The year with the hottest day was in 2010, with a temperature of 103 degrees, which interestingly enough was the year with the highest recorded annual snowfall in the dataset.\nAnnual minimum temperatures have greater temperature fluctuation, with standard deviation of 4.57 degrees. The average annual minimum temperatures was 9.52 degrees. The year with the coldest day was in 2015 at 2 degrees."
