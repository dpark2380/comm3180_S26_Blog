    "section": "",
    "text": "The Winter Olympics are built for snow, ice and mountains. Unsurprisingly, countries like Norway, Canada and Switzerland dominate the competition year after year.\nHowever, Australia seems to be an exception to this story.\n Source: The Guardian\nIn recent years, Australia’s performance at the winter olympics has been consistently improving, with them putting up the best performance yet this year, obtaining a total of 6 medals (at the time of writing this blog), beating the previous record by 2 medals set in 2022. While this is by no means as impressive as the 37 medals currently won by the first place, Norway, Australia is placed 14th on the leaderboard. Notably, all 13 countries which have performed better than Australia are in the Northern Hemisphere.\nAccording to The Guardian article, it is said that their success has come “through clever strategy and targeted resource allocation.” Out of the 16 different disciplines in the winter olympics, all of Australia’s medals came from two: freestyle skiing (moguls), and snowboarding.\nThis lead me to ask:\nDo traditionally “wintry” countries succeed because they diversify across many disciplines, while warmer nations survive through strategic specialisation? And is diversification a luxury available only to large, cold countries?\nUsing historical Winter Olympics data, this analysis explores whether geography shapes not just who wins, but how they win.\n\nSetup\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nwolympics_df = pd.read_csv('data/winter_olympics_medals.csv')\n\nwolympics_df = wolympics_df[~wolympics_df['year'].isin([2012,2016,2020])]\nwolympics_df = wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"type\"] == \"Winter\"]\n\nbios_df = pd.read_csv('data/bios.csv')\npop_df = pd.read_csv('data/populations.csv')\nmedals_df = wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"medal\"].notna()].copy()\n\nworld = gpd.read_file(\"data/worldmap.json\")\nregion_lookup = world[[\"iso_a3\", \"continent\", \"region_un\", \"subregion\"]].copy()\n\n\n\nWho dominates the Winter Olympics?\n\ncountry_totals = (\n    medals_df.groupby(\"noc\")\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medals_total\")\n    .sort_values(\"medals_total\", ascending=False)\n)\n\n\ntopN = 10\ntop_countries = country_totals.head(topN).copy()\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\nplt.barh(\n    top_countries[\"noc\"][::-1],\n    top_countries[\"medals_total\"][::-1]\n)\n\nplt.title(f\"Top {topN} Countries by Total Winter Olympic Medals (All Time)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Total medals\")\nplt.ylabel(\"\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the above bar graph, we can see that Canada and the United States dominate, having taken home 767 and 769 medals overall respectively.\nAdditionally, we can see that the top 10 countries (Canada, USA, Norway, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Soviet Union, Austria, Switzerland and Russia) are in the northern hemisphere, with colder climates and mountainous terrain.\n\nmedals_with_region = country_totals.merge(\n    region_lookup,\n    left_on=\"noc\",\n    right_on=\"iso_a3\",\n    how=\"left\"\n)\n\nworld_medals = world.merge(\n    country_totals,\n    left_on=\"iso_a3\",\n    right_on=\"noc\",\n    how=\"left\"\n)\n\nworld_medals[\"medals_total\"] = world_medals[\"medals_total\"].fillna(0)\n\nax = world_medals.plot(column=\"medals_total\", legend=True, figsize=(15,8))\nax.set_title(\"Winter Olympic Medals by Country (All Time)\", fontsize=16)\nax.axis(\"off\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world map reinforces this pattern visually. Medals are heavily concentrated in North America and Northern Europe, with the United States, Canada, Norway and Russia clearly standing out. Much of Africa, South America, Southeast Asia and Oceania show little to no historical medal presence.\nRather than being evenly distributed across the globe, Winter Olympic success is geographically clustered, with the strongest performers are located in high-latitude regions, where cold climates and mountainous terrain make winter sports both culturally embedded and relatively easier to access.\nThis geographic clustering suggests that environmental factors may shape not only participation but also the breadth of opportunity across disciplines. Countries with extensive winter infrastructure and long-standing sporting traditions may be better positioned to compete across multiple events, potentially enabling diversification which we will delve deeper into. In contrast to this, nations without natural winter conditions may need to specialise strategically in a smaller set of disciplines.\nWhilst the global pattern suggests that geography plays a significant role in success, we will now explore Australia’s steadily increasing success over the past few years, despite its climatic differences.\n\n\nIs Australia’s rise in the Winter Olympics really attributed to specialisation?\nThe Guardian attributes Australia’s recent success to “clever strategy and targeted resource allocation.” This implies that Australia does not compete broadly across the Winter Olympic programs, but instead concentrates its efforts in a narrow set of events.\nTo test this, we will examine not just medal counts, but how those medals are distributed across events.\n\ncountry_event = (\n    medals_df.groupby([\"noc\", \"event\"])\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medals\")\n)\n\ndiv_metrics = (\n    country_event.groupby(\"noc\")\n    .agg(\n        medals_total=(\"medals\", \"sum\"),\n        n_events=(\"event\", \"nunique\"),\n        top_share=(\"medals\", lambda x: x.max() / x.sum())\n    )\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\ndiv_metrics.sort_values(\"medals_total\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnoc\nmedals_total\nn_events\ntop_share\n\n\n\n\n5\nCAN\n767\n63\n0.342894\n\n\n42\nUSA\n739\n63\n0.219215\n\n\n28\nNOR\n579\n68\n0.103627\n\n\n18\nGER\n520\n67\n0.069231\n\n\n13\nFIN\n504\n43\n0.315476\n\n\n38\nSWE\n478\n52\n0.368201\n\n\n41\nURS\n440\n32\n0.381818\n\n\n1\nAUT\n336\n46\n0.083333\n\n\n36\nSUI\n313\n44\n0.178914\n\n\n34\nRUS\n246\n53\n0.174797\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the country, the total number of medals they obtained, the number of different events they participated in, and the proportion of medals which were won in each country’s strongest event.\nFrom this, we can actually see that Canada and the United States attribute a significant portion of their success to a single event. Around 34% of Canada’s medals come from its strongest event, while the United States concentrates about 22% in one area. Sweden and the former Soviet Union show even higher concentration levels, with roughly 37% and 38% of their medals tied to a single event.\nBy contrast, countries such as Germany and Norway distribute their success far more evenly. Germany’s top event accounts for just 7% of its medals, and Norway’s for about 10%, despite both nations medalling across nearly 70 different events. Austria follows a similar pattern, with only 8% concentration in its strongest event. These countries are not defined by a dominant niche but by sustained competitiveness across the programme.\nWe can see that there is a lot of geographic clustering. Canada and the United States are part of North America, while the remaining dominant nations are almost entirely European. Many of these countries, such as Austria and Switzerland, are highly mountainous, while others like Norway, Finland and Sweden benefit from long, harsh winters and strong winter sport traditions.\n\naus_events = (\n    country_event[country_event[\"noc\"] == \"AUS\"]\n    .sort_values(\"medals\", ascending=False)\n)\n\naus_events.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnoc\nevent\nmedals\n\n\n\n\n1\nAUS\n5,000 metres Relay, Men (Olympic)\n4\n\n\n3\nAUS\nAerials, Women (Olympic)\n4\n\n\n7\nAUS\nMoguls, Men (Olympic)\n3\n\n\n5\nAUS\nHalfpipe, Men (Olympic)\n2\n\n\n6\nAUS\nHalfpipe, Women (Olympic)\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop2_share_aus = aus_events[\"medals\"].head(2).sum() / aus_events[\"medals\"].sum()\ntop2_share_aus\n\nnp.float64(0.36363636363636365)\n\n\n\npop_long = pop_df.melt(\n    id_vars=[\"Country Name\", \"Country Code\"],\n    var_name=\"year\",\n    value_name=\"population\"\n)\n\npop_long[\"year\"] = pop_long[\"year\"].astype(int)\npop_long = pop_long.rename(columns={\"Country Code\": \"noc\"})\n\nmedals_with_pop = medals_df.merge(pop_long[[\"noc\", \"year\", \"population\"]],\n                                  on=[\"noc\", \"year\"],\n                                  how=\"left\")\n\ncountry_pop = (\n    medals_with_pop.groupby(\"noc\")[\"population\"]\n    .median()\n    .reset_index(name=\"population_median\")\n)\n\ndiv_metrics = div_metrics.merge(country_pop, on=\"noc\", how=\"left\")\ndiv_metrics.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnoc\nmedals_total\nn_events\ntop_share\npopulation_median\n\n\n\n\n0\nAUS\n22\n12\n0.181818\n22031750.0\n\n\n1\nAUT\n336\n46\n0.083333\n8081957.0\n\n\n2\nBEL\n16\n7\n0.312500\n11556434.0\n\n\n3\nBLR\n23\n9\n0.217391\n9448515.0\n\n\n4\nBUL\n6\n5\n0.333333\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiv_metrics = div_metrics.dropna(subset=[\"population_median\"]).copy()\n\ndiv_metrics[\"size_bucket\"] = pd.qcut(\n    div_metrics[\"population_median\"],\n    q=3,\n    labels=[\"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"]\n)\n\nsummary_by_size = (\n    div_metrics.groupby(\"size_bucket\")[[\"medals_total\", \"n_events\", \"top_share\"]]\n    .median()\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\nsummary_by_size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsize_bucket\nmedals_total\nn_events\ntop_share\n\n\n\n\n0\nsmall\n27.5\n8.5\n0.324405\n\n\n1\nmedium\n19.0\n7.0\n0.388839\n\n\n2\nlarge\n126.0\n24.5\n0.187398\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiv_metrics.columns\n\nIndex(['noc', 'medals_total', 'n_events', 'top_share', 'population_median',\n       'size_bucket'],\n      dtype='str')\n\n\n\ncountry_meta = world[[\"iso_a3\", \"continent\"]].copy()\ncountry_meta = country_meta.rename(columns={\"iso_a3\": \"noc\"})\n\ndiv_metrics = div_metrics.merge(country_meta, on=\"noc\", how=\"left\")\n\ndiv_metrics.groupby(\"continent\")[[\"n_events\", \"top_share\", \"medals_total\"]].median().sort_values(\"medals_total\", ascending=False)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[12], line 6\n      2 country_meta = country_meta.rename(columns={\"iso_a3\": \"noc\"})\n      4 div_metrics = div_metrics.merge(country_meta, on=\"noc\", how=\"left\")\n----&gt;

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nWeather patterns in Philadelphia over the past two decades point to a combination of gradual warming, declining snowfall, and substantial variability in winter conditions. Christmas Day, in particular, shows no consistent pattern. However, analysis of the weather more broadly in the past 20 years indicates a gradual increase in average temperatures alongside fewer sustained periods of heavy snowfall.\nOverall, these findings suggest that while Philadelphia winters remain highly variable, recent decades have been characterised by warmer average temperatures and reduced snowfall. Although individual years may deviate from this pattern, the long-term trends indicate that snow-filled December holiday seasons are less typical than they were two decades ago."

This suggests that, in this dataset, extraversion is linked not only to sociability but extraverted individuals tend to be more accepted in social situations. They may generally be more inclined to be able to avoid conflict or respond in a more sympathetic manner to others’ emotions.\nThere is also a moderate positive correlation between extraversion and emotional stability (r ≈ 0.26). This implies that more extraverted individuals tend to, on average, have slightly lower emotional reactivity, meaning they are calmer and less prone to stress. This means they typically enjoy initiating conversations or enjoy social interaction in general. However, the relationship is moderate rather than strong, indicating a slightly weaker correlation than with agreeableness.\nIn contrast, the correlations between extraversion and both openness and conscientiousness are relatively weak. This suggests that extraversion in this dataset is primarily associated with social and emotional tendencies, rather than intellectual curiosity or self-discipline."

Caucasian (Middle East) and Other categories also sit modestly above the overall average, at roughly 0.68 and 0.61 points higher, respectively.\nThese results align slightly with my personal account of my cultural norms. However, the difference from the overall mean is relatively small when considered in relation to the much larger range of possible extraversion scores, which span from 10 to 50. The observed deviation in extraversion score of approximately 1.41 points from the overall mean represents only a small fraction of the total scale, implying that ethnic differences don’t contribute too strongly to overall extraversion."

    "text": "Is extraversion defined by specific dominant behaviours, or is it a broader social orientation?\nEach personality trait score in the Big Five framework is calculated from ten individual questions. While these items are intended to measure a single underlying construct, this raises an important question: does extraversion reflect one particularly dominant behavioural tendency, such as talkativeness or attention-seeking, or does it instead capture a broader aspect of social interaction?\nAlthough the Big Five framework assumes that these items collectively measure a unified trait, it is not immediately obvious whether all behaviours (questions) contribute equally.

The loadings represent how strongly the question aligns / contributes to the extraversion measure.\nLooking at the loadings shown above, we can see that there is very little variation, with the loadings ranging from 0.266 to 0.348. This relatively narrow range indicates that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines extraversion. Instead, each of the 10 questions contribute in a broadly similar to an individual’s level of extraversion.\nHowever, there are specific questions which have greater loading. Here are the top three questions: 1. E5: “Start conversations.” 2. E7: “Talk to a lot of different people at parties.” 3. E4: “Keep in the background.”\nAll of these questions are in relation to active outward engagement or initiative, rather than questions around being socially comfortable (E3, E10) or being the center of attention / craving attention (E1, E9, E8) or around how much one talks (E2, E6). From this, we can conclude that although all 10 questions contribute similarly, initiative and social engagement play a slightly greater role in determining an individual’s extraversion score."

    "text": "Final Comments\nAt the beginning of this post, I asked what actually makes someone extraverted. Is it confidence, warmth, emotional stability, or simply talking more?\nLooking at how extraversion relates to other personality traits, we saw that it is most strongly associated with agreeableness and moderately associated with emotional stability. This suggests that individuals who score higher on extraversion in this dataset also tend to be more socially warm, and somewhat calmer in their emotional responses. Extraversion appears to sit within a broader social and emotional profile rather than functioning as a standalone characteristic.\nWhen examining differences across ethnic groups, the variation in average extraversion scores was relatively modest. Although some groups sat slightly above or below the overall mean, the differences wer small when compared to the full 10 to 50 range of the scale. Most of the variation in extraversion occured within groups rather than between them. This suggests that while cultural background may shape behaviour to some extent, extraversion in this dataset is primarily driven by individual differences.\nFinally, analysing the internal structure of extraversion through Principal Component Analysis showed that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines the trait. All ten questions contributed in broadly similar ways. However, behaviours related to initiating conversations and engaging actively with others showed slightly stronger alignment with the dominant component. This indicates that extraversion is less about simply talking more or seeking attention, and more about a consistent tendency to step into social situations and participate actively.\nTaken together, these findings provide a clearer answer to the question I began with. What actually “makes” an extraverted person is not one single defining behaviour, nor a single cultural influence, nor just emotional steadiness. Rather, it is a consistent inclination to engage with others and to step forward socially."
