This suggests that, in this dataset, extraversion is linked not only to sociability but extraverted individuals tend to be more accepted in social situations. They may generally be more inclined to be able to avoid conflict or respond in a more sympathetic manner to others’ emotions.\nThere is also a moderate positive correlation between extraversion and emotional stability (r ≈ 0.26). This implies that more extraverted individuals tend to, on average, have slightly lower emotional reactivity, meaning they are calmer and less prone to stress. This means they typically enjoy initiating conversations or enjoy social interaction in general. However, the relationship is moderate rather than strong, indicating a slightly weaker correlation than with agreeableness.\nIn contrast, the correlations between extraversion and both openness and conscientiousness are relatively weak. This suggests that extraversion in this dataset is primarily associated with social and emotional tendencies, rather than intellectual curiosity or self-discipline."

Although the differences are relatively small, with a total range of approximately 2.19 points, there are still observable variations from the overall mean across groups.\nSouth East Asian respondents have the lowest average extraversion score relative to the overall mean, scoring about 1.41 points below it. In contrast, West African, Bushmen, Ethiopian respondents show the largest positive deviation at approximately 0.78 points above the mean. Caucasian (Middle East) and Other categories also sit modestly above the overall average, at roughly 0.68 and 0.61 points higher, respectively.\nThese results align slightly with my personal account of my cultural norms. However, the difference from the overall mean is relatively small when considered in relation to the much larger range of possible extraversion scores, which span from 10 to 50. The observed deviation in extraversion score of approximately 1.41 points from the overall mean represents only a small fraction of the total scale, implying that ethnic differences don’t contribute too strongly to overall extraversion."

    "section": "Is extraversion defined by specific dominant behaviours, or is it a broader social orientation?",
    "text": "Is extraversion defined by specific dominant behaviours, or is it a broader social orientation?\nEach personality trait score in the Big Five framework is calculated from ten individual questions. While these items are intended to measure a single underlying construct, this raises an important question: does extraversion reflect one particularly dominant behavioural tendency, such as talkativeness or attention-seeking, or does it instead capture a broader aspect of social interaction?\nAlthough the Big Five framework assumes that these items collectively measure a unified trait, it is not immediately obvious whether all behaviours (questions) contribute equally. The following analysis will examine whether a single behaviour dominates the structure of the trait or whether extraversion is derived from a balance between behaviours.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n# Select E1–E10\nE_cols = [f'E{i}' for i in range(1, 11)]\nE_data = big5_scored_df[E_cols].copy()\n\n# Drop missing values if any\nE_data = E_data.dropna()\n\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nE_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(E_data)\n\npca = PCA()\npca.fit(E_scaled)\n\nE_pca = pca.transform(E_scaled)\n\nexplained_variance = pd.Series(\n    pca.explained_variance_ratio_,\n    index=[f'PC{i}' for i in range(1, 11)]\n)\n\nexplained_variance.round(3)\n\nPC1     0.512\nPC2     0.090\nPC3     0.081\nPC4     0.059\nPC5     0.053\nPC6     0.046\nPC7     0.045\nPC8     0.041\nPC9     0.039\nPC10    0.033\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\npc1_loadings = loadings['PC1'].sort_values(ascending=False)\n\npc1_loadings.round(3)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[7], line 1\n----&gt; 1 pc1_loadings = loadings['PC1'].sort_values(ascending=False)\n      3 pc1_loadings.round(3)\n\nNameError: name 'loadings' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\npc1_loadings.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title(\"PC1 Loadings for Extraversion Items\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Loading\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nAnalysing the loadings of first principal component (which is usually the most statsitically significant), we can conclude which aspects of one’s behaviour contribute to extrovertedness. The loadings represent how strongly the question aligns / contributes to the extraversion measure.\nLooking at the loadings shown above, we can see that there is very little variation, with the loadings ranging from 0.266 to 0.348. This relatively narrow range indicates that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines extraversion. Instead, each of the 10 questions contribute in a broadly similar to an individual’s level of extraversion.\nHowever, there are specific questions which have greater loading. Here are the top three questions: 1. E5: “Start conversations.” 2. E7: “Talk to a lot of different people at parties.” 3. E4: “Keep in the background.”\nAll of these questions are in relation to active outward engagement or initiative, rather than questions around being socially comfortable (E3, E10) or being the center of attention / craving attention (E1, E9, E8) or around how much one talks (E2, E6). From this, we can conclude that although all 10 questions contribute similarly, initiative and social engagement play a slightly greater role in determining an individual’s extraversion score."

    "text": "Final Comments\nAt the beginning of this post, I asked what actually makes someone extraverted. Is it confidence, warmth, emotional stability, or simply talking more?\nLooking at how extraversion relates to other personality traits, we saw that it is most strongly associated with agreeableness and moderately associated with emotional stability. This suggests that individuals who score higher on extraversion in this dataset also tend to be more socially warm, and somewhat calmer in their emotional responses. Extraversion appears to sit within a broader social and emotional profile rather than functioning as a standalone characteristic.\nWhen examining differences across ethnic groups, the variation in average extraversion scores was relatively modest. Although some groups sat slightly above or below the overall mean, the differences wer small when compared to the full 10 to 50 range of the scale. Most of the variation in extraversion occured within groups rather than between them. This suggests that while cultural background may shape behaviour to some extent, extraversion in this dataset is primarily driven by individual differences.\nFinally, analysing the internal structure of extraversion through Principal Component Analysis showed that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines the trait. All ten questions contributed in broadly similar ways. However, behaviours related to initiating conversations and engaging actively with others showed slightly stronger alignment with the dominant component. This indicates that extraversion is less about simply talking more or seeking attention, and more about a consistent tendency to step into social situations and participate actively.\nTaken together, these findings provide a clearer answer to the question I began with. What actually “makes” an extraverted person is not one single defining behaviour, nor a single cultural influence, nor just emotional steadiness. Rather, it is a consistent inclination to engage with others and to step forward socially."

(https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe Christmas with the greatest temperature change was in 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nChanges in Annual Snowfall\n\nannual_snow = weather_df.groupby('year')['snow'].sum()\n\nx = annual_snow.index.values\ny = annual_snow.values\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Total Snowfall, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Snowfall (inches)\")\n\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = True).head(5)\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n2010    67.3\n2014    56.9\n2009    45.6\n2005    37.0\n2011    31.6\nName: snow, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe fitted regression line suggests a decline in total snowfall over time, although snowfall remains highly variable from year to year.\n2010 saw the greatest amount of snow in the data set receiving 67.3 inches, which is 11.6 inches more than 2014, the year with the second highest snowfall. An interesting fact is that during this year’s snowstorm on January 26, certain parts of Philadelphia received 9.3 inches of snow, which is already more snow than the total yearly snowfall observed in 2023, 2012, 2008 and 2020.\n\n\nLong Term Temperature Trends\n\nweather_df['avg'] = (weather_df['high'] + weather_df['low']) / 2\n\nyearly_avg = weather_df.groupby('year')['avg'].mean()\n\n# Obtaining the index and values for the plot.\nx = yearly_avg.index.values\ny = yearly_avg.values\n\n# Creating a regression line.\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\n# Increasing size of plot.\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\n# Plotting observed data and the regression line on the same plot.\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Average Temperature, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\n\n# Adjusting the indexing so only every two years labelled.\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation: y = 0.0907 * x + -125.2568\n\n\nWe can see that there were many fluctuations in the yearly average temperature, with peaks in 2006, 2012, 2016, 2021, 2024.\nThe plotted regression line on the graph shows that the yearly average temperature increases as the years went by. More specifically, every year, the yearly average temperature goes up by 0.0907 degrees Farenheit on average. The fitted trend suggests an increase in average temperature over this period, though year-to-year variability is still large.\n\n\nChanges in Average Temperature in December over the Years\n\ndecember_df = weather_df[weather_df['date'].dt.month == 12]\n\ndec_avg_by_year = december_df.groupby(december_df['date'].dt.year)['avg'].mean()\n\n# Regression line\nx = dec_avg_by_year.index.values.astype(float)\ny = dec_avg_by_year.values.astype(float)\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed (Dec average)')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Linear trend')\n\nplt.title(\"Average Temperature in December by Year\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Temperature (°F)\")\nplt.xticks(x[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nEquation: y = 0.0760 * x + -113.4909\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression line suggests that the average December temperature has been rising slowly throughout time, increasing an average of 0.076 degrees Farenheit every year. We can also see that there was an unusually warm December in 2015, with an average temperature above 50 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nTemperature Extremes over Time\n\nhighest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['high'].max()\nlowest_temps = weather_df.groupby('year')['low'].min()\n\nx = highest_temps.index.values\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\nplt.plot(x, highest_temps, label='Annual max temp')\nplt.plot(x, lowest_temps, label='Annual min temp')\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\nplt.title(\"Annual Highest and Lowest Temperatures\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nmean_max_temp = highest_temps.mean()\nmean_min_temp = lowest_temps.mean()\n\nprint(f\"Mean annual max temp: {mean_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Mean annual min temp: {mean_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nstd_max_temp = highest_temps.std()\nstd_min_temp = lowest_temps.std()\n\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual max temp: {std_max_temp:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Std dev of annual min temp: {std_min_temp:.2f}\")\n\nyear_highest_max = highest_temps.idxmax()\nyear_lowest_min = lowest_temps.idxmin()\n\nprint(f\"Year with highest annual max temp: {year_highest_max}, temp: {highest_temps.max()}\")\nprint(f\"Year with lowest annual min temp: {year_lowest_min}, temp: {lowest_temps.min()}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean annual max temp: 98.19\nMean annual min temp: 9.52\nStd dev of annual max temp: 2.16\nStd dev of annual min temp: 4.57\nYear with highest annual max temp: 2010, temp: 103\nYear with lowest annual min temp: 2015, temp: 2\n\n\nThe annual maximum temperatures were fairly consistent throughout the 20 years, with a standard deviation of 2.16 degrees and an average maximum temperature of 98.19 degrees. The year with the hottest day was in 2010, with a temperature of 103 degrees, which interestingly enough was the year with the highest recorded annual snowfall in the dataset.\nAnnual minimum temperatures have greater temperature fluctuation, with standard deviation of 4.57 degrees. The average annual minimum temperatures was 9.52 degrees. The year with the coldest day was in 2015 at 2 degrees, but this is interesting as it had an unusually warm December as outlined previously."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWeather patterns in Philadelphia over the past two decades point to a combination of gradual warming, declining snowfall, and substantial variability in winter conditions. Christmas Day, in particular, shows no consistent pattern. However, analysis of the weather more broadly in the past 20 years indicates a gradual increase in average temperatures alongside fewer sustained periods of heavy snowfall.\nOverall, these findings suggest that while Philadelphia winters remain highly variable, recent decades have been characterised by warmer average temperatures and reduced snowfall. Although individual years may deviate from this pattern, the long-term trends indicate that snow-filled December holiday seasons are less typical than they were two decades ago."
