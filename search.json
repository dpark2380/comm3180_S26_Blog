I am here for one semester and I am excited to see what UPenn has to offer!\nAn interesting fact about me would be that I was actually born in Los Angeles, but moved to South Korea for a couple of years, before moving again to Australia where I study now. As a result, I have both an American and Australian passport.\nThis blog will outline my exploration of data and the analyses / conclusions which are derived from it."
