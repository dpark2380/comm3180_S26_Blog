    "text": "The Winter Olympics are built for snow, ice and mountains. Unsurprisingly, countries like Norway, Canada and Switzerland dominate the competition year after year.\nHowever, Australia seems to be an exception to this story.\n Source: The Guardian\nIn recent years, Australia’s performance at the winter olympics has been consistently improving, with them putting up the best performance yet this year, obtaining a total of 6 medals (at the time of writing this blog), beating the previous record by 2 medals set in 2022. While this is by no means as impressive as the 37 medals currently won by the first place, Norway, Australia is placed 14th on the leaderboard. Notably, all 13 countries which have performed better than Australia are in the Northern Hemisphere.\nAccording to The Guardian article, it is said that their success has come “through clever strategy and targeted resource allocation.” Out of the 16 different disciplines in the winter olympics, all of Australia’s medals came from two: freestyle skiing (moguls), and snowboarding.\nThis lead me to ask:\nDo traditionally “wintry” countries succeed because they diversify across many disciplines, while warmer nations survive through strategic specialisation? And is diversification a luxury available only to large, cold countries?\nUsing historical Winter Olympics data, this analysis explores whether geography shapes not just who wins, but how they win.\n\nSetup\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nwolympics_df = pd.read_csv('data/winter_olympics_medals.csv')\n\nwolympics_df = wolympics_df[~wolympics_df['year'].isin([2012,2016,2020])]\nwolympics_df = wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"type\"] == \"Winter\"]\n\nbios_df = pd.read_csv('data/bios.csv')\npop_df = pd.read_csv('data/populations.csv')\nmedals_df = wolympics_df[wolympics_df[\"medal\"].notna()].copy()\n\nworld = gpd.read_file(\"data/worldmap.json\")\nregion_lookup = world[[\"iso_a3\", \"continent\", \"region_un\", \"subregion\"]].copy()\n\nWe will first establish which countries dominate the winter olympics.\n\ncountry_totals = (\n    medals_df.groupby(\"noc\")\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medals_total\")\n    .sort_values(\"medals_total\", ascending=False)\n)\n\ntopN = 10\ntop_countries = country_totals.head(topN).copy()\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\nax.barh(top_countries[\"noc\"][::-1], top_countries[\"medals_total\"][::-1])\nax.set_title(f\"Top {topN} Countries by Total Winter Olympic Medals (All Time)\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Total medals\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedals_with_region = country_totals.merge(\n    region_lookup,\n    left_on=\"noc\",\n    right_on=\"iso_a3\",\n    how=\"left\"\n)\n\nworld_medals = world.merge(\n    country_totals,\n    left_on=\"iso_a3\",\n    right_on=\"noc\",\n    how=\"left\"\n)\n\nworld_medals[\"medals_total\"] = world_medals[\"medals_total\"].fillna(0)\n\nax = world_medals.plot(column=\"medals_total\", legend=True, figsize=(15,8))\nax.set_title(\"Winter Olympic Medals by Country (All Time)\", fontsize=16)\nax.axis(\"off\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry_discipline = (\n    medals_df.groupby([\"noc\", \"discipline\"])\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medals\")\n)\n\naus = country_discipline[country_discipline[\"noc\"] == \"AUS\"].sort_values(\"medals\", ascending=False)\naus\n\naus_by_year = (\n    medals_df[medals_df[\"noc\"] == \"AUS\"]\n    .groupby(\"year\")\n    .size()\n    .reset_index(name=\"medals\")\n    .sort_values(\"year\")\n)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\nplt.plot(\n    aus_by_year[\"year\"],\n    aus_by_year[\"medals\"],\n    marker=\"o\",\n    linewidth=2\n)\n\nplt.title(\"Australia's Winter Olympic Medal Count Over Time\", fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Number of Medals\")\nplt.grid(alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef diversification_metrics(df):\n    total = df[\"medals\"].sum()\n    shares = df[\"medals\"] / total\n    \n    return pd.Series({\n        \"medals_total\": total,\n        \"n_disciplines\": df[\"discipline\"].nunique(),\n        \"top_share\": shares.max(),\n        \"hhi\": (shares ** 2).sum(),   #

To understand how unusual this variability really is, this blog will examine daily weather records from 2005 - 2025, focusing on Christmas Day and placing it in the context of broader temperature, snowfall, and extreme weather trends.\nWe will ultimately determine if it is worth staying in Philadelphia for the holiday season.\n\nHow variable is the temperature on Christmas day in Philadelphia?\n\nchristmas_df = weather_df.query(\"day=='December 25'\").set_index('year')[['high','low']]\nchristmas_df.plot(kind = 'line', style = '-o')\nplt.title(\"Changes in Low and High Temperature for Christmas Day over Time\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Day temperatures fluctuate substantially from year to year, with no clear long term trend over the period.\n\nprint(f\"Hottest Christmas: {christmas_df['high'].idxmax()}, {christmas_df['high'].max()} degrees F.\")\nprint(f\"Coldest Christmas: {christmas_df['low'].idxmin()}, {christmas_df['low'].min()} degrees F.\")\nprint(f\"Greatest temperature change: {(christmas_df['high'] - christmas_df['low']).idxmax()}, with a temperature difference between high and low of {(christmas_df['high'] - christmas_df['low']).max()} degrees Farenheit.\")\n\nHottest Christmas: 2015, 68 degrees F.\nColdest Christmas: 2022, 18 degrees F.\nGreatest temperature change: 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nThe hottest Christmas in the dataset was in 2015, with a high temperature of 68 degrees Farenheit. An additional interesting fact is that 2015 was the hottest Christmas in any year from 1874 to 2025, tied only with Christmas in 1964. (According to https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe coldest Christmas in the dataset was in 2022, with a low temperature of 18 degrees Farenheit. However, this is still 17 degrees Farenheit warmer than the coldest Christmas day, which was in 1980 and 1983, which had a minimum temperature of just 1 degree Farenheit. (https://www.stormfax.com/phlChristmasWx.htm)\nThe Christmas with the greatest temperature change was in 2020, with a temperature difference between high and low of 39 degrees Farenheit.\n\n\nChanges in Annual Snowfall\n\nannual_snow = weather_df.groupby('year')['snow'].sum()\n\nx = annual_snow.index.values\ny = annual_snow.values\n\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\n\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Total Snowfall, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Snowfall (inches)\")\n\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = True).head(5)\nannual_snow.sort_values(ascending = False).head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\n2010    67.3\n2014    56.9\n2009    45.6\n2005    37.0\n2011    31.6\nName: snow, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe fitted regression line suggests a decline in total snowfall over time, although snowfall remains highly variable from year to year.\n2010 saw the greatest amount of snow in the data set receiving 67.3 inches, which is 11.6 inches more than 2014, the year with the second highest snowfall. An interesting fact is that during this year’s snowstorm on January 26, certain parts of Philadelphia received 9.3 inches of snow, which is already more snow than the total yearly snowfall observed in 2023, 2012, 2008 and 2020.\n\n\nLong Term Temperature Trends\n\nweather_df['avg'] = (weather_df['high'] + weather_df['low']) / 2\n\nyearly_avg = weather_df.groupby('year')['avg'].mean()\n\n# Obtaining the index and values for the plot.\nx = yearly_avg.index.values\ny = yearly_avg.values\n\n# Creating a regression line.\nslope, intercept = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)\ny_hat = intercept + slope * x\n\n# Increasing size of plot.\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\n# Plotting observed data and the regression line on the same plot.\nplt.plot(x, y, '-o', label='Observed')\nplt.plot(x, y_hat, '--', label='Regression line')\n\nplt.title(\"Yearly Average Temperature, 2005–2025\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Year\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Temperature\")\n\n# Adjusting the indexing so only every two years labelled.\nplt.xticks(annual_snow.index[::2])\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\nprint(f\"Equation: y = {slope:.4f} * x + {intercept:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation: y = 0.0907 * x + -125.2568\n\n\nWe can see that there were many fluctuations in the yearly average temperature, with peaks in 2006, 2012, 2016, 2021, 2024.\nThe plotted regression line on the graph shows that the yearly average temperature increases as the years went by. More specifically, every year, the yearly average temperature goes up by 0.0907 degrees Farenheit on average.

The year with the hottest day was in 2010, with a temperature of 103 degrees, which interestingly enough was the year with the highest recorded annual snowfall in the dataset.\nAnnual minimum temperatures have greater temperature fluctuation, with standard deviation of 4.57 degrees. The average annual minimum temperatures was 9.52 degrees. The year with the coldest day was in 2015 at 2 degrees, but this is interesting as it had an unusually warm December as outlined previously."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWeather patterns in Philadelphia over the past two decades point to a combination of gradual warming, declining snowfall, and substantial variability in winter conditions. Christmas Day, in particular, shows no consistent pattern. However, analysis of the weather more broadly in the past 20 years indicates a gradual increase in average temperatures alongside fewer sustained periods of heavy snowfall.\nOverall, these findings suggest that while Philadelphia winters remain highly variable, recent decades have been characterised by warmer average temperatures and reduced snowfall. Although individual years may deviate from this pattern, the long-term trends indicate that snow-filled December holiday seasons are less typical than they were two decades ago."

    "text": "I have never considered myself an extraverted person.\nI am not naturally what one might call “the life of the party.” I do not seek attention, and find it diffcult to be energised by large groups of people. However, I observed that personality tests often reduce extraversion to a simple score, a number that supposedly captures how social, outgoing, or talkative someone is.\nThat raised a deeper question for me; what actually makes a person extraverted?\nIs extraversion about confidence?

    "text": "Which broader personality traits are associated with extraversion?\nWe will attempt to determine whether extraversion is a trait which exists in isolation, or is correlated to an individual’s scores for agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness.

This suggests that, in this dataset, extraversion is linked not only to sociability but extraverted individuals tend to be more accepted in social situations. They may generally be more inclined to be able to avoid conflict or respond in a more sympathetic manner to others’ emotions.\nThere is also a moderate positive correlation between extraversion and emotional stability (r ≈ 0.26). This implies that more extraverted individuals tend to, on average, have slightly lower emotional reactivity, meaning they are calmer and less prone to stress. This means they typically enjoy initiating conversations or enjoy social interaction in general. However, the relationship is moderate rather than strong, indicating a slightly weaker correlation than with agreeableness.\nIn contrast, the correlations between extraversion and both openness and conscientiousness are relatively weak. This suggests that extraversion in this dataset is primarily associated with social and emotional tendencies, rather than intellectual curiosity or self-discipline."

Although the differences are relatively small, with a total range of approximately 2.19 points, there are still observable variations from the overall mean across groups.\nSouth East Asian respondents have the lowest average extraversion score relative to the overall mean, scoring about 1.41 points below it. In contrast, West African, Bushmen, Ethiopian respondents show the largest positive deviation at approximately 0.78 points above the mean. Caucasian (Middle East) and Other categories also sit modestly above the overall average, at roughly 0.68 and 0.61 points higher, respectively.\nThese results align slightly with my personal account of my cultural norms. However, the difference from the overall mean is relatively small when considered in relation to the much larger range of possible extraversion scores, which span from 10 to 50. The observed deviation in extraversion score of approximately 1.41 points from the overall mean represents only a small fraction of the total scale, implying that ethnic differences don’t contribute too strongly to overall extraversion."

    "text": "Is extraversion defined by specific dominant behaviours, or is it a broader social orientation?\nEach personality trait score in the Big Five framework is calculated from ten individual questions. While these items are intended to measure a single underlying construct, this raises an important question: does extraversion reflect one particularly dominant behavioural tendency, such as talkativeness or attention-seeking, or does it instead capture a broader aspect of social interaction?\nAlthough the Big Five framework assumes that these items collectively measure a unified trait, it is not immediately obvious whether all behaviours (questions) contribute equally. The following analysis will examine whether a single behaviour dominates the structure of the trait or whether extraversion is derived from a balance between behaviours.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n# Select E1–E10\nE_cols = [f'E{i}' for i in range(1, 11)]\nE_data = big5_scored_df[E_cols].copy()\n\n# Drop missing values if any\nE_data = E_data.dropna()\n\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nE_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(E_data)\n\npca = PCA()\npca.fit(E_scaled)\n\nE_pca = pca.transform(E_scaled)\n\nexplained_variance = pd.Series(\n    pca.explained_variance_ratio_,\n    index=[f'PC{i}' for i in range(1, 11)]\n)\n\nexplained_variance.round(3)\n\nPC1     0.512\nPC2     0.090\nPC3     0.081\nPC4     0.059\nPC5     0.053\nPC6     0.046\nPC7     0.045\nPC8     0.041\nPC9     0.039\nPC10    0.033\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\npc1_loadings = loadings['PC1'].sort_values(ascending=False)\n\npc1_loadings.round(3)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[7], line 1\n----&gt; 1 pc1_loadings = loadings['PC1'].sort_values(ascending=False)\n      3 pc1_loadings.round(3)\n\nNameError: name 'loadings' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,5))\npc1_loadings.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.title(\"PC1 Loadings for Extraversion Items\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Loading\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nAnalysing the loadings of first principal component (which is usually the most statsitically significant), we can conclude which aspects of one’s behaviour contribute to extrovertedness. The loadings represent how strongly the question aligns / contributes to the extraversion measure.\nLooking at the loadings shown above, we can see that there is very little variation, with the loadings ranging from 0.266 to 0.348. This relatively narrow range indicates that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines extraversion. Instead, each of the 10 questions contribute in a broadly similar to an individual’s level of extraversion.\nHowever, there are specific questions which have greater loading. Here are the top three questions: 1. E5: “Start conversations.” 2. E7: “Talk to a lot of different people at parties.” 3. E4: “Keep in the background.”\nAll of these questions are in relation to active outward engagement or initiative, rather than questions around being socially comfortable (E3, E10) or being the center of attention / craving attention (E1, E9, E8) or around how much one talks (E2, E6). From this, we can conclude that although all 10 questions contribute similarly, initiative and social engagement play a slightly greater role in determining an individual’s extraversion score."

    "text": "Final Comments\nAt the beginning of this post, I asked what actually makes someone extraverted. Is it confidence, warmth, emotional stability, or simply talking more?\nLooking at how extraversion relates to other personality traits, we saw that it is most strongly associated with agreeableness and moderately associated with emotional stability. This suggests that individuals who score higher on extraversion in this dataset also tend to be more socially warm, and somewhat calmer in their emotional responses. Extraversion appears to sit within a broader social and emotional profile rather than functioning as a standalone characteristic.\nWhen examining differences across ethnic groups, the variation in average extraversion scores was relatively modest. Although some groups sat slightly above or below the overall mean, the differences wer small when compared to the full 10 to 50 range of the scale. Most of the variation in extraversion occured within groups rather than between them. This suggests that while cultural background may shape behaviour to some extent, extraversion in this dataset is primarily driven by individual differences.\nFinally, analysing the internal structure of extraversion through Principal Component Analysis showed that no single behaviour overwhelmingly defines the trait. All ten questions contributed in broadly similar ways. However, behaviours related to initiating conversations and engaging actively with others showed slightly stronger alignment with the dominant component. This indicates that extraversion is less about simply talking more or seeking attention, and more about a consistent tendency to step into social situations and participate actively.\nTaken together, these findings provide a clearer answer to the question I began with. What actually “makes” an extraverted person is not one single defining behaviour, nor a single cultural influence, nor just emotional steadiness. Rather, it is a consistent inclination to engage with others and to step forward socially."
